## 1. Introduction

General Question: Understand which airlines and airports are the most recommended and the reasons for it, and investigate what drives each type of travellerâ€™s preferences.



## 2. Data

```{r read-files}
airline <- read_csv("/cloud/project/data/airline.csv")
airport <- read_csv("/cloud/project/data/airport.csv")
lounge <- read_csv("/cloud/project/data/lounge.csv")
seat <- read_csv("/cloud/project/data/seat.csv")
glimpse(airline)
glimpse(airport)
glimpse(lounge)
glimpse(seat)
```


## 3. Data analysis plan

How does the overall ratings for airlines and airports change depending of the time of year? Do these patterns repeat every year?
