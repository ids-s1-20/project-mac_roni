## Main Goal: To find the amenities that impact a flight's overall rating (in terms of Cabin, Seat, Lounge &amp; Over Time)

## Dataset for our project

# Our Dataset: Skytrax User Reviews!

.pull-left[
3 datasets (Airline ratings, Seat ratings and Lounge ratings) from a Skytrax User Reviews Dataset (published August 2nd, 2015).
- Compiled as a Github Repository by quankiquanki

Each dataset has 20 variables, and the number of observations vary depending on the dataset.

- Columns: Airline Information, Author Information, Overall Rating, Contributors to the overall rating

- Observations : each observation is a passenger that filled out a survey based on their experience of the airline, lounge or seat.

## Question 1
# How does the overall ratings for airlines change depending on the time of the year?

---

# Parameters



1. Time only ranges from 2014 to 2015 due to lack of data points for other years (n &gt; 1500 observations)

2. Overall ratings averaged by date and airline name to avoid multiple data points for the same day

3. Focus was put on the top five airlines that had the highest overall ratings


```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   airline_name     mean_overall_rating     n
##   &lt;chr&gt;                          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1 asiana-airlines                 8.35   301
## 2 garuda-indonesia                8.31   351
## 3 air-astana                      8.28   103
## 4 bangkok-airways                 8.12   213
## 5 indigo-airlines                 8.08   104
## 6 korean-air                      8.03   315
```

- These turned out to be Asiana Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Air Astana, Bangkok Airways, and Indigo Airlines.

# How does time affect the overall rating?

Main Finding: There is no significant pattern in between years or at certain times of the year. 
- One would expect airlines to offer the same service throughout each year. 

There is a subtle decrease in all airlines around the winter months -&gt; decrease in passengers -&gt; poor ratings have a greater effect on overall rating
.pull-left[
# Limitations


There are some limitations that influenced the exploration of time variable.

- Uncertainty in geom_smooth function (high)
- Limited time period (2 years)

## Question 2
# To what extent do passengers in first class give better ratings than passengers in other cabin types? 
# Note: There are 4 different cabins in this dataset ( First class, Business Class, Premium Economy, Economy)

---

Let's look at the average overall rating the passengers gave for each of the classes. 
Hypothesis: We expect first class to give the highest rating since it's generally known for offering the most plush services. 

```{r-cabin_ratings, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
airline %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(overall_rating), !is.na(cabin_flown) ) %&gt;%
  group_by(cabin_flown) %&gt;%
  summarise(mean_overall_rating = mean(overall_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(mean_overall_rating))
```

But,this doesn't match our hypothesis. It is the Business Class that tops the list, closely followed by First Class.

Is this because few number of passengers were seeking the first class services in the first place and instead chose to travel by another cabin class?

Let's find out!

---

After looking into it, that is probably the case! Out of all travelers ( for whom we do have observations),
least number of them chose to fly in the first class cabin. 

```{r-no-of-passengers, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
airline %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(overall_rating), !is.na(cabin_flown) ) %&gt;%
  group_by(cabin_flown) %&gt;%
  count(cabin_flown) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

---

Let's look into which amenities the first class cabin passengers mentioned the most about in their comments and how did they rate them? 

```{r-filter}
# I filtered for NAs for variables that I am entirely sure of looking into.
airline_amen_nonas &lt;- airline %&gt;%
  drop_na(overall_rating, value_money_rating, cabin_flown)  

```

Text analysis:

```{r-text-analysis-for-filter, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE }

two_words &lt;- airline_amen_nonas %&gt;%
  filter( cabin_flown == "First Class" ) %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, content, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %&gt;%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% 
  slice_max(n, n = 65)
#To be thorough, I have unnested the sentences into two tokens instead of just words.

two_words

```

The results reveal phrases like "wifi connectivity", "flight entertainment"  don't appear commonly, so I will choose to not look  into the amenity variable associated with those words as it is not ***highly*** spoken about by the first class passengers.

So, after narrowing the search using text analysis, seat, cabin staff and food were used to explore the ratings.

---

```{r-filter-post-text-analysis}

amen_filtered &lt;- airline %&gt;%
  drop_na(overall_rating, cabin_flown, seat_comfort_rating,
          cabin_staff_rating, food_beverages_rating)  

```

```{r-summary-statistics, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
amen_filtered %&gt;%
  filter( cabin_flown == "First Class" ) %&gt;%
  select(overall_rating, value_money_rating, seat_comfort_rating,
          cabin_staff_rating, food_beverages_rating) %&gt;%
  summarise(mean_seat_comfort_rating = mean(seat_comfort_rating),
            mean_cabin_staff_rating = mean(cabin_staff_rating),
            mean_food_beverages_rating = mean(food_beverages_rating),
            mean_overall_rating = mean(overall_rating))
```

---

```{r-variability, message= FALSE, echo= FALSE }

seat_var &lt;- y %&gt;%
ggplot( mapping = aes(x = mean_seat_comfort_rating)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs( x = "Seat comfort rating")

cabin_var &lt;- y %&gt;%
ggplot( mapping = aes(x = mean_cabin_staff_rating)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs( x = "Cabin staff rating")

food_var &lt;- y %&gt;%
ggplot( mapping = aes(x = mean_food_beverages_rating)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs( x = "Food and beverages rating")

overall_var &lt;-y %&gt;%
  ggplot( mapping = aes(x = mean_overall_rating)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs( x = "Overall rating")

collection &lt;- seat_var + cabin_var + food_var + overall_var
collection
```

This runs in line with the average statistics visualized in the tibble before.

## Question 3
# Improvements in what amenities correlate to improvement in the overal rating the most

---

---
# Definition of improvement
- sign of linear fit slope
- 3 levels 
  - -1 - got worse
  - 0 - no improvement
  - 1 - improvement

]
---
&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/repeated-rating-distribution-1.png" width="80%" /&gt;
- significantly right skewed
- most rate only twice
- hardly any people rate one airline more than 10 times
- we are left with 3640 rows and 871 unique authors

---














&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="80%" /&gt;
- we are not interested in the particular airlines but in what drives the improvement
---
Comparing the correlation coefficients between improvements in various ratings and improvements in overall rating gives a comprehensive overview of how strongly do various factors impact the overall rating

## 4 seat_comfort_rating_improvement                                0.310
## 5 inflight_entertainment_rating_improvement                      0.166
## 6 value_money_rating_improvement                                 0.442
```
- cabin staff rating correlates the strongest with the improvement in overall rating
- inflight entartainement rating correlates the least

# Question 4
#Do positive ratings on an airline and positive ratings on lounge and seat have a correlation?
---

#Difference in Ratings

Hypothesis: we expect both the seat rating and the lounge rating to both have a positive correlation to the airline rating because both are provided by the airline so this would affect the authors overall rating of the airline.

Hypothesis: we expect both the seat rating and the lounge rating to  have a positive correlation to the airline rating because both are provided by the airline.


- looked at authors that rated all three

- calculated the difference in ratings 

- shown as a percentage difference

- generally low
