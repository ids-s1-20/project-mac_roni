## Dataset for our project

# Our Dataset: Skytrax User Reviews!

.pull-left[
3 datasets (Airline ratings, Seat ratings and Lounge ratings) from a Skytrax User Reviews Dataset (published August 2nd, 2015).
- Compiled as a Github Repository by quankiquanki

Each dataset has 20 variables, and the number of observations vary depending on the dataset.

- Columns: Airline Information, Author Information, Overall Rating, Contributors to the overall rating

- Observations : each observation is a passenger that filled out a survey based on their experience of the airline, lounge or seat.

## Question 1
# How does the overall ratings for airlines change depending on the time of the year?

---

# Parameters



1. Time only ranges from 2014 to 2015 due to lack of data points for other years (n &gt; 1500 observations)

2. Overall ratings averaged by date and airline name to avoid multiple data points for the same day

3. Focus was put on the top five airlines that had the highest overall ratings


```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   airline_name     mean_overall_rating     n
##   &lt;chr&gt;                          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1 asiana-airlines                 8.35   301
## 2 garuda-indonesia                8.31   351
## 3 air-astana                      8.28   103
## 4 bangkok-airways                 8.12   213
## 5 indigo-airlines                 8.08   104
## 6 korean-air                      8.03   315
```

- These turned out to be Asiana Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Air Astana, Bangkok Airways, and Indigo Airlines.

# How does time affect the overall rating?

Main Finding: There is no significant pattern in between years or at certain times of the year. 
- One would expect airlines to offer the same service throughout each year. 

There is a subtle decrease in all airlines around the winter months -&gt; decrease in passengers -&gt; poor ratings have a greater effect on overall rating
.pull-left[
# Limitations


There are some limitations that influenced the exploration of time variable.

- Uncertainty in geom_smooth function (high)
- Limited time period (2 years)

## Question 2
# To what extent do passengers in first class give better ratings than passengers in other cabin types? 


---
# Different cabins classes
There are 4 different cabins in this dataset:
First class, Business Class, Premium Economy, Economy

Let's look at the average overall rating the passengers gave for each of the classes. 
#Hypothesis
We expect first class to give the highest rating since it's generally known for offering the most plush services. 


```
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   cabin_flown     mean_overall_rating
##   &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Business Class                 6.87
## 2 First Class                    6.65
## 3 Economy                        5.97
## 4 Premium Economy                5.86
```

But, this doesn't match our hypothesis! It is the Business Class that tops the list, closely followed by First Class.

Is this because few number of passengers were seeking the first class services in the first place and instead chose to travel by another cabin class?
---

#Passenegrs in each cabin class


```
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
## # Groups:   cabin_flown [4]
##   cabin_flown         n
##   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Economy         26429
## 2 Business Class   6133
## 3 Premium Economy  1445
## 4 First Class       846
```

Out of all travelers (for whom we do have observations), least number of them chose to fly in the first class cabin. 

---

Let's look into which amenities the first class cabin passengers mentioned the most about in their comments and how did they rate them? 





```
## # A tibble: 65 x 2
##    word            n
##    &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;
##  1 first class   936
##  2 on the        386
##  3 of the        314
##  4 in the        306
##  5 in first      274
##  6 the flight    271
##  7 to the        271
##  8 and the       261
##  9 i was         257
## 10 it was        200
## # … with 55 more rows
```

The results reveal phrases like "wifi connectivity", "flight entertainment"  don't appear commonly, so we chose not to look into the amenity variable associated with those words as it is not ***highly*** spoken about by the first class passengers.

So, after narrowing the search using text analysis, seat, cabin staff and food were used to explore the ratings.

#Summary Statistics






```
## # A tibble: 1 x 4
##   mean_seat_comfort_r… mean_cabin_staff_r… mean_food_beverage… mean_overall_rat…
##                  &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1                 3.80                3.84                3.40              6.63
```

The summary statistics reveal that the mean overall rating is 6.63 out of 10 and the flight services frequently commented about are given a similar rating (which are rated out of 5) proportionately. So, there the amenities do affect the overall rating. 

# Further verification

To verify the connection drawn, looking at the density of observations for each 
level of rating may serve as a good idea!

#Variability in ratings

This runs in line with the average statistics visualized in the tibble before.

## Question 3
# Improvements in what amenities correlate to improvement in the overal rating the most


---
# Definition of improvement
- sign of linear fit slope
- 3 levels 
  - -1 - got worse
  - 0 - no improvement
  - 1 - improvement

Comparing the correlation coefficients between improvements in various ratings and improvements in overall rating gives a comprehensive overview of how strongly do various factors impact the overall rating




```
## # A tibble: 6 x 2
##   term                                      overall_rating_improvement
##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                          &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 overall_rating_improvement                                    NA    
## 2 cabin_staff_rating_improvement                                 0.464
## 3 food_beverages_rating_improvement                              0.378
## 4 seat_comfort_rating_improvement                                0.310
## 5 inflight_entertainment_rating_improvement                      0.166
## 6 value_money_rating_improvement                                 0.442
```
- cabin staff rating correlates the strongest with the improvement in overall rating
- inflight entartainement rating correlates the least

# Question 4
#Do positive ratings on an airline and positive ratings on lounge and seat have a correlation?
---

#Difference in Ratings
Hypothesis: we expect both the seat rating and the lounge rating to  have a positive correlation to the airline rating because both are provided by the airline.

- looked at authors that rated all three

- calculated the difference in ratings 

- shown as a percentage difference

- generally low

#Observing Correlation

- correlation calculated

- found a positive correlation



```
##                airline_rating seat_rating lounge_rating
## airline_rating      1.0000000   0.5217609     0.4426391
## seat_rating         0.5217609   1.0000000     0.5211874
## lounge_rating       0.4426391   0.5211874     1.0000000
```


- airline_rating and seat_rating correlation coefficient : 0.522 (3dp)

- airline_rating and lounge_rating correlation coefficient: 0.443 (3dp)
