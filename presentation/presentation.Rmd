# Data

.pull-left[
Data: 3 datasets (Airline ratings, Seat ratings and Lounge ratings) from a Skytrax User Reviews Dataset (published August 2nd, 2015).
- Compiled as a Github Repository by quankiquanki

Each dataset has 20 variables, and the number of observations vary depending on the dataset.

- Columns: Airline Information, Author Information, Overall Rating, "Contributors to the overall rating"

- Observations : each observation is a passenger that filled out a survey based on their experience of the airline, lounge or seat.

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}

# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by JÃ¶rg Angeli on Unsplash."}
include_graphics("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535448033526-c0e85c9e6968?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1650&q=80")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.

# Question 1

Question: How does the overall ratings for airlines change depending of the time of year? Do these patterns repeat every year? Which traveller type is present during which time of the year?

---
# Question 2

---
# Question 3

```{r}
rep_rating<-airline%>%
  mutate(duplicate = duplicated(.$author))%>%
  filter(duplicate)

rep_rating_airline <-airline%>%
  group_by(author)%>%
  mutate(duplicate = duplicated(airline_name))%>%
  filter(duplicate)%>%
  arrange(date)

rep_rating_airline%>%
  summarize(count = n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=count))+
  geom_histogram()
```
We can see that not may reviewers review the same airline more than once 
```{r}
rep_rating_airline%>%
  group_by(author)%>%
  summarize(count = n())%>%
  filter(count == max(count))
```

```{r}
author_more_than_once <-airline%>%
  mutate(duplicate_auth = duplicated(.$author))%>%
  filter(duplicate_auth)%>%
  
  group_by(airline_name,author)%>%
  mutate(count = n())%>%
  filter(count>1)%>%
  ungroup()
  
author_more_than_once%>%
  group_by(author)%>%
  summarize(count = n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=count))+
  geom_histogram()
  
```
we can see that not many people rate a singe airline more than once

```{r}
anders_filtered <- rep_rating%>%
  filter(author == "Anders Pedersen")%>%
  filter(airline_name == "qatar-airways")


anders_qatar_fit<- linear_reg()%>%
  set_engine("lm")%>%
  fit(overall_rating ~ date, data= anders_filtered)

tidy(anders_qatar_fit)
  
```
