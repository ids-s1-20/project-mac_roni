# Our Dataset: Skytrax User Reviews!

.pull-left[
3 datasets (Airline ratings, Seat ratings and Lounge ratings) from a Skytrax User Reviews Dataset (published August 2nd, 2015).
- Compiled as a Github Repository by quankiquanki

Each dataset has 20 variables, and the number of observations vary depending on the dataset.

- Columns: Airline Information, Author Information, Overall Rating, Contributors to the overall rating

- Observations : each observation is a passenger that filled out a survey based on their experience of the airline, lounge or seat.

## Question 1
# How does the overall ratings for airlines change depending on the time of the year?

---

# Assumptions

```{r mean-ratings-airlines, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
airline_nonas <- airline %>%
  drop_na(overall_rating) #removing any NAs
```

1. Time only ranges from 2014 to 2015 due to lack of data points for other years (n > 1500 observations)

2. Overall ratings averaged by date and airline name to avoid multiple data points for the same day

3. Focus was put on the top five airlines that had the highest overall ratings

```{r five-highest-rated-airlines, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
airline_nonas %>%
  group_by(airline_name) %>%
  summarise(mean_overall_rating = mean(overall_rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>%
  filter(n >= 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_overall_rating)) %>%
  head()
```

- These turned out to be Asiana Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Air Astana, Bangkok Airways, and Indigo Airlines.

  ) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Airline Name")) 
```
---

# How does time affect the overall rating?

Main Finding: There is no significant pattern in between years or at certain times of the year. 
- One would expect airlines to offer the same service throughout each year. 

# Limitations

.pull-left[
There are some limitations that influenced the exploration of time variable.

- Uncertainty in geom_smooth function (high)
- Limited time period (2 years)

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Question 1

Question: How does the overall ratings for airlines change depending of the time of year? Do these patterns repeat every year? Which traveller type is present during which time of the year?

---
# Question 2

To what extent do passengers in first class give better ratings
than passengers in other cabin types? 
Note: There are 4 different cabins in this dataset ( First class, Business Class, Premium Economy, Economy)

Let's look at the average overall rating the passengers gave for each of the classes. 
Hypothesis: We expect first class to have a higher rating since, as per the norm, first class is considered to be the most preferable one.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
airline %>%
  filter(!is.na(overall_rating), !is.na(cabin_flown) ) %>%
  group_by(cabin_flown) %>%
  summarise(mean_overall_rating = mean(overall_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_overall_rating))
```

Business class has received the highest amount of rating. It is closely followed by 
First class. This doesn't match our hypothesis. 

Is this because passengers feel the business class services are better or fewer people choose
to travel in first class?
Let's find out!

---



```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
airline %>%
  filter(!is.na(overall_rating), !is.na(cabin_flown) ) %>%
  group_by(cabin_flown) %>%
  count(cabin_flown) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Now, it is obvious that first class has a lower rating compared to business 
class since fewer passengers chose that cabin type.

# Do airline improve their rating with a particular customer over time
First we need to filter out all the reviewers who didn't rate a airline twice
```{r filter-repeated-authors}
author_more_than_once <-airline%>%
  mutate(duplicate_auth = duplicated(.$author))%>%
  filter(duplicate_auth)%>%
  group_by(airline_name,author)%>%
  mutate(count = n())%>%
  filter(count>1)%>%
  ungroup()
```
after filtering out the reviewers who didn't rate a single airline more than once we are left with `r nrow(author_more_than_once)` and `r length(unique(author_more_than_once$author))` unique authors
---
```{r repeated-rating-distribution, echo=FALSE,  message=FALSE}  
author_more_than_once%>%
  group_by(author)%>%
  summarize(count = n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=count))+
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(
    title = "Repeated rating of one airline",
    subtitle = "by one customer",
    x = "times rated",
    y = "number of reviewers"
  )
  
```
- significantly right skewed
- most rate only twice
- hardly any people rate one airline more than 10 times

# 4: Do positive reviews on an airline and positive reviews on lounge and seat have a correlation?

Hypothesis: we expect both the seat rating and the lounge rating to both have a positive correlation to the airline rating because both are provided by the airline so this would affect the authors overall rating of the airline.

- looked at authors that rated all three
- calculated the difference in ratings 
- shown as a percentage difference

#Observing Overall Differences

- Mean calculated to find overall percentage difference in ratings

```{r, echo = FALSE}
abs_data %>%
  select(percentage_difference_in_airline_and_lounge_rating, abs_percentage_difference_in_airline_and_seat_rating, author) %>%
summary()
```

From Table
- mean percentage difference in lounge and airline ratings: 33.84 %
- mean percentage difference in seat and airline ratings: 24.73 %

To further look into what affects the authors' ratings we decided to see if the seat and lounge ratings had any correlation to airline ratings. Our hypothesis for this was that we would expect both the seat rating and the lounge rating to have a positive correlation to the airline rating because both are provided by the airline so this would affect the authors overall rating of the airline.

To do this, the authors that rated all three were selected and a table was compiled of the ratings so that  with duplicates being filtered out. Then the difference in the ratings were compared. The graphs show the percentage difference between the authors ratings of lounge and airline, and seat and airline. We can see that in general the percentage differences are quite low despite there being a few exceptions.

To try and see more clearly what the percentage differences were like we found the mean percentage difference and found that the seat rating had a stronger correlation to the airline rating as the mean percentage difference between the seat and airline ratings is slightly lower than lounge and airline suggesting that the ratings were more similar. 

The value of the mean percentage difference is quite low  which suggests our hypothesis was correct and that they do have a correlation. This then suggests the seat and lounge will have an affect on the authors rating of the airline and flight even though there was only a proportion of authors that rated all three.
