# Our Dataset: Skytrax User Reviews!

.pull-left[
3 datasets (Airline ratings, Seat ratings and Lounge ratings) from a Skytrax User Reviews Dataset (published August 2nd, 2015).
- Compiled as a Github Repository by quankiquanki

Each dataset has 20 variables, and the number of observations vary depending on the dataset.

- Columns: Airline Information, Author Information, Overall Rating, Contributors to the overall rating

- Observations : each observation is a passenger that filled out a survey based on their experience of the airline, lounge or seat.

## Question 1
# How does the overall ratings for airlines change depending of the time of year?

---

# Assumptions

```{r mean-ratings-airlines, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
airline_nonas <- airline %>%
  drop_na(overall_rating) #removing any NAs
```

1. Time only ranges from 2014 to 2015 due to lack of data points for other years (n > 1500 observations)

2. Overall ratings averaged by date and airline name to avoid multiple data points for the same day

3. Focus was put on the top five airlines that had the highest overall ratings

```{r five-highest-rated-airlines, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
airline_nonas %>%
  group_by(airline_name) %>%
  summarise(mean_overall_rating = mean(overall_rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>%
  filter(n >= 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_overall_rating)) %>%
  head()
```

- These turned out to be Asiana Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Air Astana, Bangkok Airways, and Indigo Airlines. 

---

# Overall Rating versus Time

```{r five-highest-ratings-plot, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
airline_nonas %>%
  group_by(airline_name, date) %>%
  summarise(mean_overall_rating = mean(overall_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(airline_name %in% c("asiana-airlines", "garuda-indonesia", "air-astana", "bangkok-airways", "indigo-airlines"),
         date >= "2014-01-01") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = mean_overall_rating, color = airline_name)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Overall ratings of five highest ranked airlines",
    subtitle = "From 2014 to 2015",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Overall Rating"
  ) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Airline Name")) +
  theme_minimal()
  
```

# Overall Rating versus Time Explained 

.pull-left[
General Trends: 

- Passengers that fill out the survey tend to give high overall ratings
- There is no significant pattern in the overall ratings when comparing different years


Trends in Specific Airlines at the start of 2015: 

- Air Astana -> higher ratings in comparison to 2014
- Garuda Indonesia -> similar ratings in comparison to the last year
- Asiana Airlines, Bangkok Airways, and Indigo Airlines -> lower ratings in comparison to 2014.

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.

# Question 1

Question: How does the overall ratings for airlines change depending of the time of year? Do these patterns repeat every year? Which traveller type is present during which time of the year?

---
# Question 2

---
# Question 3

```{r}
rep_rating<-airline%>%
  mutate(duplicate = duplicated(.$author))%>%
  filter(duplicate)

rep_rating_airline <-airline%>%
  group_by(author)%>%
  mutate(duplicate = duplicated(airline_name))%>%
  filter(duplicate)%>%
  arrange(date)

rep_rating_airline%>%
  summarize(count = n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=count))+
  geom_histogram()
```
We can see that not may reviewers review the same airline more than once 
```{r}
rep_rating_airline%>%
  group_by(author)%>%
  summarize(count = n())%>%
  filter(count == max(count))
```

```{r}
author_more_than_once <-airline%>%
  mutate(duplicate_auth = duplicated(.$author))%>%
  filter(duplicate_auth)%>%
  
  group_by(airline_name,author)%>%
  mutate(count = n())%>%
  filter(count>1)%>%
  ungroup()
  
author_more_than_once%>%
  group_by(author)%>%
  summarize(count = n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=count))+
  geom_histogram()
  
```
we can see that not many people rate a singe airline more than once

```{r}
slopes <- function(data) {
  fited <- linear_reg()%>%
  set_engine("lm")%>%
  fit(overall_rating ~ date, data= data)
  return(tidy(fited)$estimate[2])  #return the slope
}
```
```{r}
(slopes(author_more_than_once))

```
```{r}
df2 <- author_more_than_once %>% 
  group_by(author,airline_name) %>% # group by variable state
  filter(!is.na(date),!is.na(overall_rating))%>%
  do(data.frame(model = tidy(lm(overall_rating~date, data=.)))) %>% # for each group run a linear fit and save the output as a date table
  ungroup # forget about your initial grouping
df2
```

```{r}
df2 <- df2%>%
  filter(model.term == "date")%>%
  mutate(improvement=sign(model.estimate))%>%  #did they improve or not
  group_by(airline_name)%>%
  mutate(mean_improvement = mean(improvement))

df2$airline_name = reorder(df2$airline_name, df2$mean_improvement)

df2%>%
  filter(!is.na(mean_improvement))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_improvement))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)

```


We can see that most airlines don't improve from flight to flight but with the improvement mean being `r mean(df2$mean_improvement,na.rm=TRUE)`
